Transitioning from TCS to a Product Based Company like Amazon or Microsoft can be challenging, but with dedication 💪 and hard work, it is definitely achievable! 💪

After facing rejection from a few service-based companies like Wipro and TCS, I realized the importance of strengthening my DSA skills. 

Here's what helped me make the switch and land a 7LPA to 42LPA job offer:

📍Focused on mastering the basics of DSA before moving on to more complex topics.
📍Dedicated time to learning System Design, both LLD and HLD.
📍Consistently practiced problem-solving to build confidence and efficiency.
📍Took part in mock interviews to assess my weaknesses and improve.

By continuously learning and growing, I was able to secure a high-paying job at a top product-based company 💼. 🚀
